# Blog-GraphQL
This is a full-stack project for writing blogs and articles.

Description :

This is a full-stack project for writing blogs and articles. Next.js is used on the front-end side and GraphQL is used on the back-end side. To display notifications, React Tostify is used and Material UI is used to style the pages. It is also possible to comment on each article separately. In addition, React Router Dam has been used for routing between pages. The entry page and the register page have control of the type of input data for each field and display the appropriate error message if wrong information is entered.
